## What is Cycle Touring?
Cycling Touring, Bike Touring or Bicycle Touring is essentially traveling by a period of days, weeks, months or years, across a state, country or countries. There are 4 types of touring that we’ve heard of:

 1. Credit Card Touring = cyclists carry the very basics, then pay for things like meals, supplies, accommodations.
    - (+) More comfortable, less weight
    - (-) expensive, less freedom
 2. Organized touring = Route is planned and trip organized by an outside party
    - (+) convenient, social, security
    - (-) expensive, less freedom
 3. Vehicle-Supported Touring = A support vehicle travels with you to store most of your equipment as you ride.
    - (+) Less worry about having lightweight gear, travel farther/easier
    - (-) more expensive, need to find someone to drive.
 4. Self-Supported Touring = *What we do* Carry everything you need (camping, cooking, gear, tools, etc) with you on your bicycle.
    - (+) lots of freedom, least expensive
    - (-) requires more gear and effort.

## Who travels by bicycle?
It can be done individually, with friends, or with a commercial tour operator. There is not one image of a bicycle traveler. People of all ages, backgrounds, and regions of the world choose to travel by bike. We’ve met adults in their seventies and children in their teens (and younger!) who have ridden all across America and beyond.

Bicycle travel is attractive for many reasons:
  - It’s an exciting challenge that allows us to explore new landscapes and cultures
  - It builds physical fitness/ health
  - Experience the joy of breathing fresh air
  - Meeting new people every day.

## How do you train for a bike tour?
You don't need to be a super-athlete to enjoy traveling by bike. The best thing to do is to be realistic about what you can do and create achievable goals. You’ll be riding into progressively better and better shape as you go, and you will find your body adapts to being on a bike all day.

***How much training is recommended*** It depends on how long your tour is.  If it’s 2 years, don’t worry about training as much. The first month or two will be an adjustment but you have plenty of time to enjoy the strength you will get. If you are touring for a week or two, train beforehand so it’s not a shock and you can enjoy it. Our friend who joined us for 2 weeks without previous experience or training, did considerably great  but it was very hard for her for the entire 2 weeks. She was finally getting the hang of it as her tour ended.

***If training, what should you concentrate on?*** For bicycle touring, riding speed and training heart rate are less important than endurance. Just spend as much time on the saddle as possible and ride back-to-back long days if possible. Doing practice rides with weight is also a good idea to get used to the balance and to make sure you bike is ready for a tour

***How much did we train?** Our tour is self-supported with no specific time-line. We have the freedom to stop whenever we don’t feel like going more for the day.  Since we were working as adventure guides in the Peruvian Andes right before our tour, we were in good physical shape but neither of us had been on a bike for 4 months before heading off in Alaska. Our first day on tour we did 15  miles and were so exhausted we slept 12 hours straight.  You don’t need to be in great cycling shape to do a tour. You can do 10 miles a day or however many you feel like or your body is up for. The underlying theme throughout is that mental toughness trumps physical fitness.There will be many hard climbs. The wind or weather can be awful. But the best part is, none of these things will stop you. You will get stronger every day, and soon 30-40 miles comes easy. Then 60-70 miles. As long as you don’t lose it mentally (which might happen at time), your body will follow. Just make sure you take breaks every now and then and give your legs and mind a rest!

## What do you pack?

#### The less weight you carry, the more fun it is to ride

[Gear]({{ site.baseurl }}/gear)

***How do you carry everything?*** The most common methods of carrying gear are panniers and trailers. We use panniers which are luggage that attaches to your bicycle on racks that sit over or next to the wheels. Panniers excel on paved-road riding. Single-wheel trailers are at their best on rough, unpaved terrain. Both  can work well for nearly all types of touring. It’s all down to personal preference. We like having panniers because we feel more balanced, they’re easy enough to pack and carry, and we don’t take up as much space on the road.

***How much does your loaded bike weigh?***  I have no idea how much our panniers weigh. People ask this all the time. I’ve hear you want your total weight between 15 and 45 pounds. We just try to have our bikes at light as possible with still having everything we need and like to have for the tour.

Some people recommend putting most of your weight in your front panniers (60%), I like most of my weight on my back wheel, because it feels more stable and I have a stronger back rack. In general make sure it’s balanced and each side weighs nearly the same. One tip is not to put too much weight on top of your racks, as it’s not the best for the wheel. It’s better to have the weight on the sides (in the panniers). We will usually carry something lightweight like the sleeping bags on top of the rack.

## What kind of bike is recommended?
We love the Trek 520. It’s affordable, durable, light, and extremely comfortable. We dominated our first Alaska mountains. We also love having disc brakes because they aren’t as affected by extreme weather and the bike is still rideable if a wheel is out of true.
People have been riding bikes long distances for many decades, and plenty of them weren’t necessarily “suited for touring”. We met one man up in Canada who biked thousands of miles on a single-speed bike in the 70s. When I had my bike stolen 2 months into the journey, I built a “new” bike out of recycled parts from old bikes from a community bike shop. It has a Trek mountain bike frame and parts that look far from shiny and new but they’re solid. That bike has made it across continents and is holding strong. A bonus is that the wheels are size 26 and the tube sizes are easier to find in Latin America and the valve can be used at any gas station. With Gordon’s wheels, we learned that we had to stock up on tubes, and get a presta valve adapter.

Trust the company of the bikes! We love riding Trek bikes because it’s a reliable company and their customer service is AMAZING. Whenever we’ve had issues they have been more than helpful.

The important characteristics to look for:

  - Durability
  - A comfortable riding position (various hand positions, the right size for your height, etc)
  - Low gears for climbing hills
  - The ability to mount fenders and racks
  - Solid tires- Depending on where you are riding and how long, we recommend 32mm or more width. Look for “anti- puncture ” material.

## How far can I ride in a day?

How many miles/km you go in a day depends on many things: how much daylight there is, if the terrain is flat or mountainous, the weather, how you’re feeling, bike breakdowns, if you meet someone cool and chat for hours, etc.

On average, we ride 60 miles/ 100km a day but depending on all of the above, we will ride more or less. Most often we will ride less not because we are tired but because we had a late start and ran out of sunlight :)

Experienced bicycle travelers can ride further, but for most people, planning to exceed these averages has a tendency to increase the physical challenge and decrease the enjoyment. We also recommend that you plan for at least one rest day a week. Remember to stretch/foam roll/yoga every day, especially the rest day! This will help your endurance.

## Where do I stay at night?
First you must decide if you want to camp (inexpensive, independent, closer to nature) or stay in hotels (comfortable, less gear to carry). Tourism agencies, visitor’s associations, and many internet resources list information about motels, campgrounds, B&Bs, and other lodging.

We spend the night in various ways:

 - Gorilla camp (Find a place to set up camp in the woods//nearly every night in Alaska and Canada) = aprox.  20%
 - Organized campsite or asking to camp in the yard of a house or restaurant = aprox. 25%
 - Couchsurfing or Warm Showers (online hospitality website for bicycle tourists) = aprox. = 25%
 - Kind people who we meet along the journey who invite us into their home = aprox. 15%
 - Cheap hostels/motels in Latin America/ ($5- $15/ night) - aprox. 15%

*Rarely do we know in the morning where we will sleep each night. It always has worked out.*

## What do you eat?

Originally we were eating a lot of boiled eggs and peanut-butter nutella sandwiches. Half-way through the journey Meg pinned down that she had a dairy and egg intolerance.  We have started to concentrate more on getting nutritious foods that will REALLY fuel our bodies. We eat a lot of nuts and seeds, potatoes, veggies, FRUIT, brown rice, quinoa, and beans.

 - For remote touring Harmony House (www.harmonyhousefoods.com) has great products of dehydrated veggies that are very affordable! When are sure to add spices/hot sauce/pesto to give more flavor to our meals.
 - When we aren’t in remote areas, we will stop at a small market every-other day to pick up fresh foods.

Tips:

 - Keep dry fruits, nuts, seeds and energy bars in your front bag and snack often.
 - Be sure to drink more water than you think you need to prevent dehydration. Drink at least 3 to 4 liters of water a day. When you are thirsty, it’s already too late. Rehydration salts/ electrolytes are key!
 - Make sure you are getting your vitamins. A Vitamin deficiency can cause a lot of issues and although you will be eating a lot of food, it is important to eat the right kinds of foods to make sure you are getting all of the vitamins needed for your active lifestyle.
    - **Vitamin C**: Immune Booster
    - **Foods**: Citrus fruits, tomatoes, strawberries, pineapple kale, broccoli.
    - **Vitamin E**: Antioxidant, protects your cells, muscles, and lungs.
    - **Foods**: almonds, olive oil, eggs, leafy greens
    - **Magnesium**: Muscle and nerve function, blood pressure.
    - **Foods**: green leafy vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains, chocolate (easy to get through your diet, but also easy to lose through sweat)
    - **Potassium**: Helps to maintain balance of fluid inside our cells.
    - **Foods**: bananas, figs, raisins, dates
    - **Iron**: builds red blood cells that carry oxygen to your muscles (low= risk of developing anemia, leaving your chronically tired. Women are more at risk due to menstruation)
    - **Foods**: spinach, meats (avoid coffee if you develop an iron deficiency)

## How much does bicycle touring cost?

The cheapest way to go is to camp and cook your own meals. Assuming you have all the necessary gear before you leave, a budget of $15-$50/ day (depending on the country) should be enough to pay for camping fees and groceries and still stash a bit away for unforeseen expenses like repairs or gear replacement. Going dirtbag-style, it’s possible to travel on $10/day or less. You can get by on a tiny budget in countries like Mexico and Colombia, and in countries like the U.S., Canada, Costa Rica, you will be spending more.  The beauty of traveling by bike is that it can be as comfortable or as adventurous as you want it to be. It is entirely  possible to be safe, warm and well-fed while at the same time being cost-efficient.

In our personal experience, we only had around $12,000 saved between the two of us when we started our bike tour in Alaska. To break that down, for two years we would have a budget of $250/each/month. That is doable but we would have to be very careful to keep to our budget and it doesn’t leave much room for emergencies, breakdowns, visa fees, insurance, etc. We have decided to work along the way, picking up temporary jobs when we can and continuing to work remotely and seasonally with the non-profit travel organization, Operation Groundswell, that we had been involved with previously. This has allowed us room to live on a slightly higher budget and not be too worried when unexpected expenses pop up (which you can count on happening).

We will likely be spending close to $25,000 for our entire tour, with a goal to have $2,000 each left in our bank accounts when we are done touring. To summarize, $1,000/month for two people is a reasonable budget for this type of tour. $1,500/month is quite comfortable and you can do more off-bike activities (while still mainly camping and cooking) .

Then you have people like Alastair Humphreys, who did a 4 year 3 month bicycle tour around the world with a budget of £7,000 ($9127.26) which is £135/month ($176.03). Anything is possible!

## Is it safe?
The simple answer: Yes.

Bicycle travelers are typically perceived to be non-threatening and are often treated warmly by strangers, especially during emergencies. Media is great in that it allows us to stay informed about global issues and events, yet since the majority of news shared is negative, it has created or supported a common culture of fear in people around the world. Fear of foreign places, foreign people, foreign traditions, cultures, religions. We are never exposed to the whole truth of a place until we are immersed in it. Use common sense, especially in places you’ve never been in and ask advice from local people about safety.

Animals and traffic are another story. Be informed, educated and prepared for wildlife and always be visible to traffic (bright clothes, reflective vest, day lights). Be prepared to pull off the road when you hear a car if there is a small shoulder and never ride at night, during heavy rain, or heavy fog.

The chances of something bad happening to you during a bicycle tour is likely to be no different than the chance are in your everyday life at home.

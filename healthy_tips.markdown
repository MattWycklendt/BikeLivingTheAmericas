There are enough things that can happen while traveling by bike that are out of your control. One thing you do have control over is how to prevent common bicycle touring injuries. Over the past year living on a bike, there have been times when I’ve ignored my body and I’ve learned from those mistakes the hard way. Here is some advice on how to stay as healthy as possible while on a bike tour.

1. **Get a proper set up on your bike.**
There are many different opinions on the style and type of bike to go with. Although I’m a Trek girl all the way, there are many other worthy bikes that would work great for long tours. What is most important is that your bike fits you. You will be spending a lot of time on your bike and you need to be comfortable. Many bike shops do ‘Bike Fits’ to check to make sure the height of your seat and length of your stem is set correctly. When your bike is fitted to you, this means you will be more in sync and able to ride with your whole body, lessening the chance for injury.

2. **Keep your body fueled**
Traveling by bicycle is amazing in that you use your body to get from point A to point B. But just like a car, your body needs fuel. You will likely be consumed by thoughts of food anyways, so be sure to eat frequently. If you are spending long days on the bike, you will need more than just 3 meals a day. Keep dry fruits, nuts, seeds and energy bars in your front bag and snack often. Make sure to load up on fruit, veggies and good grains (quinoa and brown rice). Don’t forget to spice up your meals!
Additionally, be sure to drink more water than you think you need to prevent dehydration. Drink at least 3 to 4 liters of water a day. When you are thirsty, it’s already too late. Rehydration salts/ electrolytes are key! Keep your thirst quenched and your hunger satisfied to keep your body feeling strong and adaptive of the bikelife.

3. **Use a travel foam roller!**
I can not suggest bringing a foam roller on your tour enough. My foam roller has been a life-saver on numerous occasions. By using a foam roller, you are releasing muscle tightness and trigger points. It’s something that I would recommend to anyone, whatever their day looks like, but especially for bicycle tourists. By applying pressure to specific points on your body, you are helping those muscles to recover to a elastic, healthy and strong state.
It is common to feel “knots” in your muscles and without releasing them, your muscles can tighten further which puts you at more risk for injury. Although stretching is good, it is not always successful in releasing tight knots. A couple minutes of foam rolling before and after a day on the bike can easily release muscle tightness and support normal blood flow and function through your muscles. It hurts so good!

4. **Vitamins and Minerals are your friends.**
A Vitamin deficiency can cause a lot of issues and although you will be eating a lot of food, it is important to eat the right kinds of foods to make sure you are getting all of the vitamins needed for your active lifestyle. There are 5 main vitamins to keep track of.

    - Vitamin C: Immune Booster
      - Foods: Citrus fruits, tomatoes, strawberries, pineapple kale, broccoli.

    - Vitamin E: Antioxidant, protects your cells, muscles, and lungs.
      - Foods: almonds, olive oil, eggs, leafy greens

    - Magnesium: Muscle and nerve function, blood pressure.
      - Foods: green leafy vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains, chocolate (easy to get through your diet, but also easy to lose through sweat)

    - Potassium: Helps to maintain balance of fluid inside our cells.
      - Foods: bananas, figs, raisins, dates

    - Iron: builds red blood cells that carry oxygen to your muscles (low= risk of developing anemia, leaving your chronically tired. Women are more at risk due to menstruation)
      - Foods: spinach, meats (avoid coffee if you develop an iron deficiency)

    I was experiencing cramping due to vitamin deficiency and after being more intentional with my foods,  taking a daily multi-vitamin and drinking more electrolytes, my cramping has stopped.

5. **Take a rest day at least once a week**
Rest days save you time in the long run. Biking a slow 60 miles (100km) in a day might not seem like a huge feat but biking that length day after day adds up. Your body needs time to recover. As long as you aren’t racing or working towards a record, there’s no rush. If you won’t do it for your body, do it for your mind.

6. **Use all of the gears on your bike.**
Although I have met people who have done long tours on a 1 speed bike (people are cool), you will likely have a 7-11 speed bike for a tour. Please, if you have gears, use them. There is no reason to suffer up a hill in a high gear. There will soon be another climb, and you’re likely to burnout quick or kill your knees. Move into lighter gears for inclines and spin your legs at a steady cadence (typically 70 to 90 pedal revolutions per minute)
*Clip-in pedals are awesome for climbs but keep clipped out whenever possible to let your feet and legs move slightly to prevent your muscles from tightening. Bike smart! Your legs will thank you.*

7. **Don’t overlook your hygiene**
I’m proud to be a ‘dirty traveler’ but there are limits when it comes to health and hygiene. I have gone 2 weeks without a shower (multiple times). I’ve worn the same clothes for days and a laundry day can be rare. These things are part of the adventure and you will soon adapt to the simple life of a dirty bicycle traveler but you can’t completely forget about your hygiene.
Be sure to change your clothes after riding. I will usually have a pair of riding clothes and a pair of relaxing/sleeping clothes. Remember to air-out both sets of clothes when you are not wearing them. Whenever a shower is available, take advantage of it. When there isn’t a shower available, clean your skin down with baby wipes.
When talking about bicycle hygiene, chafing is not always discussed but is a HUGE issue! If you aren’t already aware, do NOT wear underwear under your cycling shorts (this is not a light suggestion). Be sure to use Chamois Butt’r or vaseline (the cheap and non-allergenic option) to prevent saddle sores. If you do get a saddle sore, apply bag balm to the irritated area after a shower and it should clear up overnight. Prevention is the way to go when it comes to issues and injuries related to hygiene.

8. **Keep your core strong.**
A strong core is essential to long-distance biking. While we may be concentrating on keeping our lower body strong and healthy, it is our core muscles that keep our body upright and provide a stable platform for our hips and legs to work. Back pain is a common complaint from long-distance cyclists and a strong core will allow for better positions and less side-to side movement, preventing back and hip injuries, and reducing the amount of friction on the saddle. Personally, I practice yoga once a day to keep my core strong and flexible and it has done wonders!

9. **Easily prevent numbing of the hands.**
Another common bicycle touring injury is developing numb hands. I’ve had it and it’s not pleasant. The good news is that it is easily preventable. The key is to have a variety of hand positions available and be sure to wear cycling gloves that have gel padding. A couple months into my tour, I added bar ends on my handlebars to provide more options and learned to relax more on the bike, not gripping so tightly.

10. **Listen to your body.**
It’s challenging to know what pain is normal and expected and what needs more attention. I have a pretty good intuition and when I trust my gut, I know what my body is telling me. Don’t ignore your body. Don’t choose to “cycle through” everything. Take a break, use your foam roller, or maybe take a day or few off the bike to fully recover. Two months into my bike tour, my left leg cramped up so bad that I had to take 2 weeks off the bike. That was an important lesson for me. Don’t wait until it’s too painful to ride to do something about a tight muscle or a body alignment that doesn’t feel right. If you ignore your body, it won’t be long until it forces you to listen.
Cheers to a healthy and happy bike tour!

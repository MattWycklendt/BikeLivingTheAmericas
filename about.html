<p>Turn on the news these days and most of what we hear about is crime, injustice, natural disasters, fear and hate. Although we strive to stay informed and refuse to be blind to the horrible things that are happening in the world, we know that in every instance of devastation and injustice, there are people who step up and show raw compassion and determination for change. We want to highlight and share stories of the amazing people who are doing something to move towards positive change, and inspire us to follow. </p>
<p>The newspapers and TV have made us paranoid. We're terrifed of people. From our experience traveling we have learned to be cautious, aware of our surroundings, and street smart, but more than that we have found that for the vast majority of the time, people are good. They are kind, resilient, motivated and have incredible stories.</p>
<p>Thoughout our entire journey across North and South America, we will be blogging about local initiatives we come across, influential and compassionate people, and inspiring stories to uplift us and restore faith in humanity.</p>
<p><b><i>Because really traveling for us, it's always all about the people. </i></b></p>

        <h3>Megan Wycklendt</h3>
        <p>Megan is proud to call her home Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, USA. While most of her life has been spent in the Cheese State, at age 10 she moved to Monterrey, Mexico for a few years and has since been fascinated by different cultures.  Having traveled over 30 countries, Megan loves adventure and finding new challenges. She has been dreaming of this Pan-American journey for nearly 8 years and cannot wait to be on the road. To prepare, she has been long-distance biking in her homeland and races on a cycling team to learn everything from how to fix bikes to bike safety.</p>
        <p>With a life motto, “Lo bailado, nadie te lo quita” (Nobody can take from you what you’ve danced), Megan collects memories and learns through experience. She currently teaches yoga, breathing, and meditation as an Art of Living teacher, is program leader for the NGO, Operation Groundswell, and will be graduating in May with a Masters in School Counseling from the University of Wisconsin, Whitewater.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>

<p>Gordon and Megan met while volunteering with a local Peruvian NGO, Pisco Sin Fronteras, in 2011. They both share a passion for travel, adventure, embracing foreign cultures, and supporting causes for positive change in the world. During their encounter in Peru, they talked a lot about a shared dream to cycle the Americas from Alaska to the southern-most tip of Argentina, and for the last three years they have been planning this journey from opposite sides of the world, with Gordon in Sydney, Austrailia, and Megan in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. What would we do without skype?!  This dream has been coming to fruition as they are due to turn it into reality in August 2015 when they set off from Anchorage, Alaska!</p>

<p>Gordon and Megan currently both work for a wonderful non-profit organization, Operation Groundswell, that offers travel and community service experiences around the world. They aim to build a community of "backpacktivists" that are socially, environmentally and politically aware of their impact in the communities they travel to and live in. We've been extensively trained on how to ethically travel and volunteer to not cause more harm than good by our presence in foreign communities, and we consistently reflect on our beliefs and actions. Gordon and Megan will be leading travel and service learning programs in Peru from May until August and from there will dedicate the next couple years of their lives to cycling the Americas. Although this journey is not formally connected with Operation Groundswell, they will use everything they have learned from their work with OG in their interactions along the Americas.</p>

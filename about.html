<h3>Megan Wycklendt</h3>

<p>Megan is proud to call her home Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, USA. While most of her life has been spent in the Cheese State, at age 10 she moved to Monterrey, Mexico for a few years and has since been fascinated by different cultures.  Having traveled over 30 countries, Megan loves adventure and finding new challenges. She has been dreaming of this Pan-American journey for nearly 8 years and cannot wait to be on the road. To prepare, she has been long-distance biking in her homeland and races
on a cycling team to learn everything from how to fix bikes to bike safety.</p>

<p>With a life motto, “Lo bailado, nadie te lo quita” (Nobody can take from you what you’ve danced), Megan collects memories and learns through experience. She currently teaches yoga, breathing, and meditation as an Art of Living teacher, is program leader for the NGO, Operation Groundswell, and will be graduating in May with a Masters in School Counseling from the University of Wisconsin, Whitewater.</p>

<h3>Gordon Dunlop</h3>

<p>Gordon hails from the west coast of Scotland and despite living, working and travelling in a number of different countries, he still sees his hometown of Largs as one of the most beautiful places on earth!  Sydney, Australia is currently home until May 2015 when he is off to Peru to work for the NGO, Operation Groundswell.</p>

<p>His passion for travel, fuelled by a year of volunteering and travelling in South America in 2011, Gordon is fulfilling a long-held ambition to cycle the Americas and is excited by the experiences and opportunities they will encounter en route.</p>

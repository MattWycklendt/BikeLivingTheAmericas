##Saturday 24th October: Clinton to Lillooet

Despite having reached the Clinton Valley and the promise of warmer weather, we survived our
coldest night of camping yet as the mercury tumbled to -4°C (24°F.)  A frosty morning meant an early
start. There’s nothing quite like attacking a hill on a bike to warm the blood! We also had a 76 mile
day ahead of us in order to camp in the (relative) warmth of Lillooet. Camping here would give us
the best chance of conquering the infamous mountain switchbacks, on the Lillooet to Pemberton
road, in one day.

After an ascent out of Clinton, we got on some nice, fast downhills towards the cut-off for highway
99 and the trip through the mountains towards Whistler.  The early part of the 99 was beautiful – a
change in landscape from the rugged, wintery terrain of central BC to rolling green fields, quaint
farmhouses and autumnal colours as we neared more coastal climes. We had some fun downhills as
we followed the railway towards Lillooet, though, a long, tiring day was to have a sting in the tail
with some really tough climbs getting into Lillooet.

Thankfully we reached our destination before dark and knocked on the door of Fr Bob Haggerty (a
friend of Michael from William’s Lake) who kindly welcomed us in. Michael had suggested we speak
to Fr Bob as he’d likely put us up in the church hall which, not having to take down tents and re-pack
bikes, would allow us to get an earlier start for what promised to be a testing day ahead. We cooked
up a nice meal and had a great chat with Fr Bob which centred around the recent Canadian election
and Irish history and emigres.  He talked at length about a fascinating band of Irishmen who’d been
sentenced to death, on charges of sedition, by the British courts in the 19th century.  After having
their sentences reduced and escaping a life living as convicts in Australia, they went on to do great
things in North American politics. One of these men, Thomas Francis Meagher, would crop up in a
later conversation with Margo and Chris in Vancouver (see Thanksgiving the Americas post) as he
was a distant relative of Margo’s! As it transpired Fr Bob opened the doors, not to the church hall
but to the church itself.  I couldn’t help but think we needed all the prayers we could get for what lay
ahead tomorrow and were therefore sleeping in the right place!  Having spent many nights guerrilla
camping by the roadside, others in the lovely homes of many a warm showers host, one night on a
school bus and another in an airstream caravan, this was certainly the most unexpected
accommodation we’d encountered!

##Sunday 25th October: The day of reckoning – Lillooet to Pemberton

Meg and I had been deliberating since the offset on whether or not to take this route as we’d been
warned of the arduous climbs but that we’d be rewarded with incredible scenery.  The day started
well – an early start, hearty breakfast and on the road ready to attack the mountains. Then, after just
two minutes of riding, I heard the sickening ping of another spoke blowing on my back wheel. Today
of all days! After muttering an expletive or four, the initial frustration subsided and I resolved to
getting the bike roadworthy again.  By this time, I’d become a bit of an expert at the rear wheel
spoke change and so was back on the road soon enough to try to catch up with Meg who had gone
on ahead to get a head start on the mountains.

The climbs out of Lillooet were ridiculously steep. The sort where, if we lost momentum in our
pedalling, we’d have rolled back down the hill!  I remember being happy just to get a ‘break’ on a
steep incline as opposed to the sheer cliffs we were scaling at times.  My legs were really heavy and
the pain in my IT band, which had been giving me trouble for the past week, began to intensify.  I’d
never cycled such steep climbs and, with four full panniers, it felt like I was towing a caravan! It
seemed like I was stopping every two minutes to wipe away sweat, re-hydrate and to show some
mercy to my leg muscles.  As I was beginning to wonder if I’d be able to reach Pemberton before
nightfall, a car overtook me and, with a toot of the horn, gave me a thumbs up.  This did wonders for
my spirits and I began to focus on positive thoughts to help me overcome these mountains. The
Mary’s Meals mug I have attached to my handlebars is a great aid to help me focus. I began to
wonder how arduous it must be to walk for hours, in desert heat, in search of clean drinking water.
Or to sit through a school day, unable to concentrate, because your stomach is so sore from hunger.
These thoughts certainly put my current travails into perspective.

After a quick lunch before getting back on the saddle, the hills continued.  Shortly after refilling my
water bottles at a gloriously fresh mountain spring, I reached the picturesque Duffy Lake.  Knowing
that the downhill stretch to Pemberton wasn’t too far off, I began to think that I was going to make
it. At this, the adrenaline started pumping and I finally began to actually enjoy the beautiful scenery.
By now, however, my knee was really feeling the strain on the uphill.  Then, rounding a corner on
what would prove to be our last steep ascent, the beautiful, snow-capped peak of Mt Currie
revealed itself and, as it did so, the choral crescendo at the end of The Rolling Stones, “You can’t
always get what you want” was playing on my playlist.  I laughed out loud at how ridiculously apt
this piece of music was for the moment!  It gave me a real lift and all thoughts of pain subsided as
the hills began to roll more gently toward the descent to Pemberton.

The descent down to the town of Pemberton was every bit as steep as the morning’s ascent– fun but
a little scary!  I finally caught up with Meg while we were stopped at roadworks.  We were almost
beating the cars downhill and, by the time we got to the bottom, we could actually smell the burning
from our disc brakes!  From the bottom of the mountain we had a nice easy ride into Pemberton and
a most welcome of Warm Showers with Anna and Nikki.

##Monday 26th October: Destination Whistler!

I’d been looking forward to this day since we first decided we’d attack Highway 99. As a Scotsman
travelling a long way from home, I don’t have too many opportunities to bump into many friends en
route. However, in the ski resort of Whistler, I had two friendly faces ready to welcome us! A good
friend from my time living in Birmingham, England had offered to put us up for a couple of days.  The
thought of getting a couple of beers, and a long overdue catch up with Tony, was what had spurred
me on through my IT band troubles of the last week. Not only that, but the manager of the local Irish
pub just happened to be a childhood friend from my hometown, Gordon Auld!  Gordon very kindly
shouted us lunch and what was probably the hardest-earned pint of Guinness in my life!  It was so
surreal to see a childhood friend so far from home and we had a great laugh about old times.

Tony arrived a little later after his shift, at the Four Seasons hotel, for another nostalgia session.
We’d played football together in what was a great football club in Birmingham with an even better
social scene.  We’d spent many a Saturday night at the Junction bar in Harborne and it was just like
turning back the clock.  Tony was a fantastic host during our break in Whistler, as were his
housemates Sean, Eddie and Dean – all very welcoming!  Before leaving Whistler, Tony set us up
with a training session at his hotel with their resident fitness guru, ultra runner Paul Romero.  Paul
gave us some great tips for the road (as well as giving me a bit of a dressing down for the state of my
back!) and some contacts along the coast of his native California. We had a great session with Paul
and enjoyed a superb breakfast, at the Four Seasons, courtesy of Tony. We did feel a bit out of place
sitting at the breakfast table with our oil-stained, fluorescent yellow cycle jerseys while the big wigs
from the company, who were there for a conference, shared the restaurant with us!  As we left
Whistler, Tony remarked how great it was to meet up with someone, after five years, and to just pick
up where we left off as if we’d seen each other yesterday.  I couldn’t agree more!

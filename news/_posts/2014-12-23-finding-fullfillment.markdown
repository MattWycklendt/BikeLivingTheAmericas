<h4 class="section-heading">What 3 things or experiences bring me the greatest sense of fulfillment in life?</h4>

<p><b>1. Love.</b></p>
<p>Most of the time when we think of love, we think of romance. While this love is wonderful and important, it’s not acknowledging the many other sources of love in our life.Expressing the many outlets of love through faith, family, friendships, relationships, and serving others is what gives my life meaning.</p>

<p><b>2. Knowledge.</b></p>
<p>As long as I am alive, I will try to learn something new every day. Whether it be in a classroom, from a book, a conversation, an observation or a reflection, at the end of each day, I hope to know more than when I woke up.</p>

<p><b>3. Adventure.</b></p>
<p>Life is an adventure and should be experienced instead of watching it pass by. I am addicted to life-enhancing experiences. Although I love the chance to broaden my perspective through travel as much as possible, I try to find adventure wherever I am.  There are adventures to be had every day. Every challenge or every problem to be solved can be an adventure. It’s all about perception.</p>

<h4 class="section-heading">Small things I do every day to feel happy/fulfilled</h4>

<p><b>Pray and practice gratitude.</b> Tomorrow is not a guarantee. I keep a gratitude journal to end each day with appreciation for the special details of my life and for the people I have met.</p>
<p><b>Make connections.</b> They don’t need to be life-long friendships but you never know when a conversation with a stranger can change your life or theirs. Kindness is everything.</p>
<p><b>Dance.</b> I will dance with or without music, in a group of people or at home by myself, on a dance floor or in a grocery store. Life is one big dance! (I take it literally)</p>

<h4 class="section-heading">My secret to happy productivity</h4>

<p><b>Attitude.</b> If you think you can’t do it, you’re right. If you think you can do it, you’re right.</p>

<p>Finding purpose in what you do. Living a meaningful life is not about having an impressive resume or listing the things you’ve done, places you’ve been or tasks you’ve accomplished. It’s easy to get caught up in all of the little details of our projects and responsibilities but we must not lose sight of the purpose behind it all. For me, it’s about being in continuous service and it looks like love. Giving it freely expands all possibilities. Being present with people and with nature.</p>
<p>Being in awe of the little, common things and practicing gratitude.</p>

<p><b>Letting go.</b> Life should be touched, not strangled. Follow your dreams, put 100% effort in and then let life happen. So much is out of our control. I have learned not only to live with but appreciate the imperfections and fallen plans. Everything in life is in perfect order, whether you understand it yet or not.</p>

<h4 class="section-heading">The best way to spread happiness and fulfillment to others</h4>

<p>Every person has the power to impact their environment either positively or negatively. It is the attitude you bring to the world that has the most potential for change. Be natural, make authentic connections, and show enthusiasm for others’ dreams and ideas. One person may not be able to change the world, but they might end up changing the life of the one person who will.</p>

<p>“And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same” – Marianne Williams- Our Greatest Fear</p>
<p>A quote I live by: </p>
<blockquote>“Lo bailado, nadie te lo quita” Which means, “Nobody can take from you what you’ve danced.” Instead of collecting material possessions, invest in experiences that will allow you to grow. And don’t forget to have some fun : )</blockquote>

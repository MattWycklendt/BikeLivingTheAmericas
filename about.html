<h3>Our Story</h3>

<p>Gordon and Megan met while volunteering with a local Peruvian NGO, Pisco Sin Fronteras, in 2011. They both share a passion for travel, adventure, embracing foreign cultures, and supporting causes for positive change in the world. During their encounter in Peru, they talked a lot about a shared dream to cycle the Americas from Alaska to the southern-most tip of Argentina, and for the last three years they have been planning this journey from opposite sides of the world, with Gordon in Sydney, Austrailia, and Megan in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. What would we do without skype?!  This dream has been coming to fruition as they are due to turn it into reality in August 2015 when they set off from Anchorage, Alaska!</p>

<p>Gordon and Megan currently both work for a wonderful non-profit organization, Operation Groundswell, that offers travel and community service experiences around the world. They aim to build a community of "backpacktivists" that are socially, environmentally and politically aware of their impact in the communities they travel to and live in. We've been extensively trained on how to ethically travel and volunteer to not cause more harm than good by our presence in foreign communities, and we consistently reflect on our beliefs and actions. Gordon and Megan will be leading travel and service learning programs in Peru from May until August and from there will dedicate the next couple years of their lives to cycling the Americas. Although this journey is not formally connected with Operation Groundswell, they will use everything they have learned from their work with OG in their interactions along the Americas.</p>

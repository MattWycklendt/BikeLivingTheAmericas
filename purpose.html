<h3>Poverty Alleviation Through Education</h3>

<p>Beginning August 2015, together we are planning to embark on a cycle covering the length of the American continents. Naturally, we are intent on combining this adventure with raising money and awareness for a worthwhile cause that promotes positive change in the world.  The cause to which we are dedicating our trip is that of poverty alleviation through education, in the belief that every child deserves the right to an education so they be given the platform to unleash their potential.</p>

<p>We are focused on both the Scottish charity, Mary's Meals, which works to give children one hot meal per day in their place of education, combined with Global Giving projects with an education focus in Latin America.</p>

<p>We hope to engage with a number of these projects during our journey and all of the money that is donated through these links will be going to poverty alleviation through education. None of the money donated will be taken out for our personal expenses.</p>


<p>Please read further about these worthy initatives and DONATE by clicking on the links below.<p>

<p><i>The links will be reconnected to the fundraising pages soon. Thank you for your patience.</i></p>

        <p><b>A Simple Solution to World Hunger</b></p>
        <p>Mary's Meals is an international movement that sets up school feeding projects in communities where poverty and hunger prevent children from gaining an education.</p>
        <p>Mary's Meals is a simple idea that works - by providing a daily meal in a place of education, chronically poor children are attracted to the classroom where they can gain a basic education that provides an escape route from poverty.</p>
        <p>We are thrilled to support Mary's Meals. They have a sustainable model whereby grain is locally sourced and local people are fully engaged in the food projects as well as the many building projects the organization has also funded. </p>
        <p>We want to suppport organizations with sustainable plans to provide kids with basic needs, classrooms and educational resources, and trained teachers. Knowledge is power and we think every child should have the opportunity to improve their life situation, and we believe an education is essential to that goal. </p>
